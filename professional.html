                My most memorable youth summit was the IASAS international student leaders summit on the imporance of mental health for leaders. 
                The summit was held at 
                <a href="http://www.sun.ac.za/english">Stellenbosch University</a> 
                in South Africa. The best part about the summit was that it introduced us to the local and cultural ways of managing their mental health post-Apartheid.
