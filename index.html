            <h2>
                My name is 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milica"> Milica</a> 
                Jordanov, but most people call me Mili.

            <p> 
                 I originally come from 
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia">Serbia</a>, but  
                 when I was 16, I left home to pursue my education which lead me to interchangeably live between the US and China. 
                 Now, I am a senior at 
                 <a href="https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/zh">Duke Kunshan University</a> 
                 but currently study abroad at 
                 <a href="https://duke.edu/">Duke University</a>.
                 After graduation, I plan to find a job in which the IT and sustainability industry intertwine in order to combine both of my passions with my strengths in management and business.
